   description: "A teen wakes up in a clearing in the center of a gigantic maze with no memory of his past, finding himself a resident in community of boys who have built a village in the glade and who sends two of its strongest and fittest runners into the maze every morning to find a way out.",
   summary: "Thomas, a teenager, arrives in a glade at the center of a giant labyrinth. Like the other youths dumped there before him, he has no memory of his previous life. Thomas quickly becomes part of the group and soon after demonstrates a unique perspective that scores him a promotion to Runner status -- those who patrol the always-changing maze to find an escape route. Together with Teresa, the only female, Thomas tries to convince his cohorts that he knows a way out.",
