   summary: "Thomas, a teenage boy, is one of the subjects in an experiment conducted by a government agency known as WICKED. When a manmade disease, known as the Flare, is introduced to the human population, WICKED starts running experiments to find a cure. Thomas and several of his friends have been an ongoing part of these experiments. When WICKED offers to remove a swipe implant from the subjects' brains to return all of their memories to them, Thomas and a few of his friends opt out of the procedure and plan an escape from WICKED. WICKED continues to hunt Thomas and his friends down because Thomas holds the key to their final experiment. After traveling to Denver, Thomas and his group meet members of the Right Arm, a group organized to bring down WICKED.",
